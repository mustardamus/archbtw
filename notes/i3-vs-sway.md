# I3 vs Sway

Currently there are two setups. The default Sway with Wayland, and an I3 with X11.
Sway works great, but it crashes when I connect a external USB monitor with DisplayLink.
So until then, maintain the two side by side, until it is fixed in Sway.

I3 is set as the default session. But you can log out of the session with
`Super+Shift+E`, and switch the window manager.
